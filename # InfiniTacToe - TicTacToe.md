# InfiniTacToe -  TicTacToe

Welcome to InfiniTacToe, a modified version of the classic TicTacToe game where the possibilities are (probably) endless! Alternatively to the original version, in this game every fourth move by the player (if the winner has yet to be defined) automatically erases his oldest mark on the board, ensuring the game stays dynamic and unpredictable.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: InfiniTacToe is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. **Marking**: Players take turns marking O (first and every other odd click) or X (second and every other odd click) on empty cells.
3. **Replacement**: After a specific number of moves without a win, a player's fourth mark is placed in an empty cell, erasing their oldest mark on the board.
4. **Winning**: The winning condition is the same as the classic game, this way your surefire winning tatic (may) also work here.
